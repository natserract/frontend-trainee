## Upload File From Scratch
Goals: Learn how to build an upload file component from scratch in React.

1. Parse the uploaded files: Validate the files (e.g. check format, size), and extract the data into a clean format.
2. Handle the parsed file data.
3. Integrate with APIs: Use Axios, React Query for API calls.
4. React hooks as a first class.
5. Add drag and drop support.
