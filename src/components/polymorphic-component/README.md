## Polymorphic Component

Polymorphic component is a component that can render different underlying HTML elements based on the props passed to it. It allows you to create reusable components that can adapt their rendered output based on the desired semantics or styling.

## Polymorphic component benefit and use cases

Polymorphic components in React provide several benefits and use cases. Here are some of the key advantages and scenarios where polymorphic components are useful:

1. Flexibility: Polymorphic components allow you to use different underlying HTML elements or custom component implementations based on the needs of your UI. This flexibility enables you to reuse the same component logic and styling while adapting the rendered output to different contexts.

2. Accessibility: Polymorphic components promote accessibility by allowing you to choose the appropriate semantic HTML element based on the content and context. For example, a polymorphic Button component can render as a <button> element for native button behavior, or as an <a> element for links, ensuring proper accessibility and keyboard navigation.

3. Consistent API: Polymorphic components provide a consistent API across different element types. By defining a common set of props and behavior, you can ensure a uniform usage and experience for developers across different instances of the component.

4. Styling and Theming: Polymorphic components provide a way to encapsulate styles and apply them to different element types. You can define a base set of styles and easily extend or override them when rendering as different elements. This makes it easier to apply themes, customize the appearance, or adapt to different design systems.

5. Component Composition: Polymorphic components can be composed with other components to build more complex UI structures. They serve as building blocks that can be combined and nested to create reusable and flexible UI patterns.

6. API Design: Polymorphic components allow you to design APIs that are more intuitive and expressive. By choosing appropriate prop names and using common patterns, you can create components that are easier to understand and use, improving the developer experience.
