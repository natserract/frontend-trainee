## Recursive Component benefit and use cases
1. Nested Data Structures: Recursive components are particularly useful when dealing with nested data structures, such as hierarchical data or tree-like structures. They allow you to represent and render the data in a natural and intuitive way. For example, you can use a recursive component to render a nested comment thread or a directory tree.
2. Dynamic and Flexible Rendering: Recursive components enable dynamic rendering based on the structure and depth of the data. You can render an arbitrary number of nested elements without knowing the exact depth in advance. This flexibility is ideal for scenarios where the depth or nesting of the data can vary.
3. Code Reusability: Recursive components promote code reusability. By defining a recursive structure, you can reuse the same component to render different levels of nesting. This can result in more concise and maintainable code compared to manually creating separate components for each nested level.
4. Data Transformation and Manipulation: Recursive components can be used for data transformation and manipulation tasks. For instance, you can use a recursive component to traverse a tree-like structure and apply specific operations or calculations to the data at each level. This can be useful for tasks like filtering, searching, or transforming the data structure.
5. User Interfaces with Hierarchical Navigation: Recursive components are well-suited for building user interfaces that involve hierarchical navigation. For example, you can use a recursive component to create a multi-level menu or a nested navigation sidebar. This allows users to navigate through different levels of content or functionality.
6. Dynamic Forms: Recursive components can be utilized to build dynamic forms that have fields with nested subfields. This is beneficial when dealing with complex data structures, such as nested objects or arrays. Recursive components allow you to recursively render form fields based on the structure of the data, enabling a more flexible and scalable form implementation.

## Data Structure
```ts
[
    {
        path: "menu-1",
        link: "/menu-1",
        text: "Menu 1",
        children: [
            {
                path: "menu-1.1",
                link: "/menu-1.1",
                text: "Menu 1.1",
            },
            {
                path: "menu-1.2",
                link: "/menu-1.2",
                text: "Menu 1.3",
            },
        ],
    },
    {
        path: "menu-2",
        link: "/menu-2",
        text: "Menu 2",
    },
]
```
